## Overview

Zustand Q is an enhanced state management library built on top of [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand), designed for **React** and **React Native** applications. It combines the simplicity of Zustand with powerful asynchronous state management capabilities, similar to [Tanstack React Query](https://tanstack.com/query). Whether you're fetching data, mutating state, or persisting data across sessions, Zustand Q provides a lightweight and intuitive solution.

## Purpose

The goal of Zustand Q is to streamline state management in modern React applications by offering:

- **Asynchronous state handling**: Manage API calls and mutations with ease.
- **TypeScript-first design**: Strong typing for better developer experience.
- **Simple devtools and persistence**: Debug and persist state without complex middleware.

## Key Benefits

- **Asynchronous State Management**: Built-in support for queries (data fetching) and mutations (data updates).
- **Developer Tools**: Easily integrate with Redux DevTools using `devtoolsName`.
- **Persistence**: Save state to local storage with a single `persistName` configuration.
- **Flexible Selectors**: Access state with dot notation or function-based selectors.
- **Type Safety**: Improved TypeScript types for state, actions, queries, and mutations.

Zustand Q is perfect for developers who want a minimal yet powerful state management tool for both small and large-scale applications.
