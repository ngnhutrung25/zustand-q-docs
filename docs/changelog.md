## Version History

### v0.1.2 - 2025-04-03

_Initial Release_

The first public release of Zustand Q, introducing a lightweight state management library with async superpowers built on top of Zustand.

- **Features**:

  - Added support for **queries** to fetch data asynchronously and update the store (see [Queries](./api-reference/queries)).
  - Added support for **mutations** to handle CRUD operations with async workflows (see [Mutations](./api-reference/mutations)).
  - Introduced the `useStore` hook for simple, type-safe global state management (see [useStore](./api-reference/use-store)).
  - Enhanced **selectors** with both string and function-based syntax for efficient state access (see [Selectors](./api-reference/selectors)).
  - Added `devtoolsName` option in `createStore` for debugging with Redux DevTools (see [createStore](./api-reference/create-store)).
  - Added `persistName` option in `createStore` for persisting state to local storage (see [createStore](./api-reference/create-store)).

- **Improvements**:

  - Improved TypeScript support with generic types for `TState`, `TActions`, `TQueries`, and `TMutations`, ensuring type safety across the library.
  - Optimized integration with Zustand v5.0.3 for better performance and compatibility.

- **Documentation**:
  - Launched initial documentation site with guides and examples (e.g., [Cat List](./examples/cat-list)).
